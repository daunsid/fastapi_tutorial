This is a FastAPI-based project designed to build high-performance APIs with Python. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Features

- Fast and efficient API development.
- Automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).
- Built-in validation and serialization using Pydantic.
- Asynchronous support for high-performance applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd fastapi
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
